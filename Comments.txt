4. A reflection on my article:
  a. what were you aiming for? 
    - I am interested in old buildings and wanted to find out how those in Philadelphia managed well, and introduce Philadelphia's relevant policy.
  b.  what went well, what didn't?
    - Found nice map images and a great introduction to attract readers' interests 
    - Data integration (year to age) stands of readers
    - Good explanation of data
    - Still have to conclude the story: have to introduce there is still blind spot of old building management in Philadelphia
    - Couldn't solve coordination issue (the map very bottom of the article)
  c. what did you learn? did you try anything new?
    - Learned the city manages old buildings very systematically, but not many.
    - Tried to find some new data source other than ACS
  d. if you had an infinite amount of time and could make it perfect, what would you like to see improved in the next draft?
    - Make conclusion
    - Make story intersection more natural
